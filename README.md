As a mission-driven Data Scientist, I'm committed to using data to better society - especially where machine learning, healthcare, and economics are concerned. I'm impassioned by teaching and derive immense joy from helping others reach their "aha" moment. 

In my professional journey, I've spearheaded the conception and implementation of a comprehensive data platform, requiring remote collaboration with leaders across the organization to gather analytical requirements. I developed scalable ELT pipelines to consolidate data from mobile and web applications and third parties. Additionally, I created intuitive dashboard interfaces for business users to access real-time metrics at their convenience. 

I possess a unique blend of technical prowess and business acumen, allowing me to lead projects from start to finish. I have been commended and recognized for my stellar communication skills, ability to problem-solve complex challenges involving data in the healthcare space, and for driving a positive culture in a remote company. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree from Ohio Wesleyan University, where I double majored in Data Analytics and Business Administration. In my undergraduate years, I founded a startup to teach small businesses how to maintain low-tech data collection and dashboarding frameworks. I received the Burton D. Morgan Research Award for my research proposal contingent upon completing research on fostering a culture of innovation within larger organizations. 

Please feel free to reach out! I'm available for coffee chats and would love to discuss all things data (or whatever else is on your mind).
