  ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
</h3>
<br>
<p>
  I'm Katelyn, a Data Scientist based in Columbus, OH.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I love all things data and am currently working as a Data Scientist at Prescient AI. My experience ranges from developing pipelines to product analytics to neural networks. I feel most excited when I'm learning something new and I love creating helpful resources to teach others! 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Outside of work, I love to hit the gym, read, golf, and hike. I enjoy chatting about pretty much everything, but productivity and entrepreneurship have a special place in my heart :)
